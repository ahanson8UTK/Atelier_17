Your answer for today's questions should be entered at the bottom of irfs.R as usual. But you need not run the code itself. I have precompiled the results into a Shiny app. So you should only need to download the folder irf_app. Change the R working directory to wherever you save the folder (not INSIDE the irf_app folder). Then from the R command line type shiny::runApp('irf_app/app.R')
